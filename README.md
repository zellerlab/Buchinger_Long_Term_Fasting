# Buchinger long-term fasting

This repo contains all analysis code and required data to reproduce the analyses and figures from a collaboration between the Buchinger-Wilhelmi clinic, EMBL and Princeton university on understanding the effects of long-term fasting on composition and function of the gut microbiome, as well as on serum metabolomics. This study combines data of two different studies, namely Genesis and OralFast and the preprint can be found here (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.04.19.590209v1).

To reproduce all results and figures from our paper, you should start with running the Data_Prep_Cleaning.Rmd script. Afterwards you can run all the other scripts!
